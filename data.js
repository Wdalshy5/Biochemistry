    step: 1,
    front: "Step 1",
    back: "Glucose → G6P",
    explanation: "Step 1: Converting glucose into glucose 6-phosphate. This step is controlled by hexokinase and takes one ATP molecule."
  },
  {
    step: 2,
    front: "Step 2",
    back: "G6P → F6P",
    explanation: "Step 2: Glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) is converted into fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) by isomerase."
  },
  {
    step: 3,
    front: "Step 3",
    back: "F6P → FBP",
    explanation: "Step 3: Fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) is phosphorylated by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) to form fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), consuming one ATP."
  },
  {
    step: 4,
    front: "Step 4",
    back: "FBP → DHAP + G3P",
    explanation: "Step 4: Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) is split by aldolase into two 3-carbon molecules: DHAP (dihydroxyacetone phosphate) and G3P (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate)."
  },
  {
    step: 5,
    front: "Step 5",
    back: "DHAP → G3P",
    explanation: "Step 5: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is converted into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) by the enzyme triosephosphate isomerase."
  },
  {
    step: 6,
    front: "Step 6",
    back: "G3P → 1,3-BPG",
    explanation: "Step 6: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) is oxidized by GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) while generating NADH."
  },
  {
    step: 7,
    front: "Step 7",
    back: "1,3-BPG → 3PG",
    explanation: "Step 7: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) donates a phosphate group to ADP to produce ATP and forms 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG)."
  },
  {
    step: 8,
    front: "Step 8",
    back: "3PG → 2PG",
    explanation: "Step 8: 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) by phosphoglycerate mutase."
  },
  {
    step: 9,
    front: "Step 9",
    back: "2PG → PEP",
    explanation: "Step 9: 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) is dehydrated by enolase to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)."
  },
  {
    step: 10,
    front: "Step 10",
    back: "PEP → Pyruvate",
    explanation: "Step 10: Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) donates a phosphate group to ADP, producing ATP and forming pyruvate, the final product of glycolysis."
